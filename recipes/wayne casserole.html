  <h2>Baked cheese with layers of meat,vegetables,biscuitdough e.t.c</h2>
  <p>John wayne casserole is named after none other than the actor himself,<br>
     Marion Robert Morrison, aka John Wayne. Wayne's casserole is 
     described as being made with eggs and cheese — it wasn't until <br>
     much later that other ingredients such as biscuits, onions, 
     bell peppers, and jalapeños were added to the recipe to give it a<br>
     more Southwestern taste.

  <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (16.3 ounce) can refrigerated biscuits</li>
      <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
      <li>1 (1 ounce) package taco seasoning</li>
      <li> ¾ cup water</li>
      <li> 1 medium onion, halved and sliced</li>
      <li> 1 medium red bell pepper, halved and sliced (1 1/2 cups)</li>
      <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
      <li>½ cup mayonnaise</li>
      <li>8 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
      <li> 2 medium tomatoes, sliced</li>
      <li>1 (4 ounce) jar sliced jalapeno peppers, drained (Optional)</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Make the crust: Press the biscuit dough in the
         bottom and up the sides of a prepared baking dish.<br> 
         Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned.</li>
      <li>Cook the meat: Cook the beef until crumbly.
          Drain the fat, stir in seasoning and water<br>
          and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer.
          Transfer the meat to a bowl.</li>
      <li>Cook the veggies: In the same pan, cook 
          the sliced onions and peppers until tender.</li>
      <li>Make the creamy layer: Combine the sour cream, mayo,
          1/2 of the Cheddar, and 1/2 of the cooked 
          veggies in a bowl. </li>
      <li> Layer and bake the casserole: Layer the meat, tomatoes, 
           onion-pepper mixture, jalapeños,<br> and sour cream mixture 
           on top of the biscuit dough. Sprinkle it with cheese.<br>
           Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is browned 
           and bubbly. </li>
    </ol>
