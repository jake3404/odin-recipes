  <h2>Honey-Garlic Glazed Salmon</h2>
    <p>This savory-sweet salmon is quick and easy enough for
       weeknights (ready in under 30 minutes),<br> but is also fancy enough
       for special occasions (like a last-minute Father's Day surprise)</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/3 c. honey</li>
      <li>1/4 c. low-sodium soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tbsp. lemon juice</li>
      <li>1 tsp. red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>3 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
      <li>4 6-oz. salmon fillets, patted dry with a paper towel</li>
      <li>Kosher salt</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 lemon, sliced into rounds</li>
    </ul>
   <h3>Steps</h3> 
     <ol>
       <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together honey, 
        soy sauce, lemon juice and red pepper flakes.</li> 
       <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, 
        heat two tablespoons oil.<br> When oil is hot but not smoking, 
        add salmon skin-side up and season with salt and pepper.<br>
        Cook salmon until deeply golden, about 6 minutes, 
        then flip over and add remaining tablespoon of oil.</li> 
        <li>Add garlic to the skillet and cook until fragrant, 1 minute.<br>
            Add the honey mixture and sliced lemons and 
            cook until sauce is reduced by about 1/3.<br> 
            Baste salmon with the sauce</li>
        <li>Garnish with sliced lemon and serve.</li>   
     </ol>
